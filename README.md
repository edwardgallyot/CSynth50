###### The PortAudio Library:

The Port Audio Library and its documentation has made this final project possible
and is very portable. There is a branch that I have created to support Mac OS Catalina
on my laptop and the library transfered over from Linux with ease.

You can find the PortAudio Library along with it's great docs [here](http://www.portaudio.com/)


###### The portmidi Library

The portmidi library I believe is part of portmedia as is portaudio and has examples in on their
git hub and although it takes some time to get comfortable with the way the port time callback works, 
I have some projects that I can share with anyone who needs a simpler way of testing portmidi.

The PortMedia API information can be found [here](http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/)
