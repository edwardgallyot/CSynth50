###### The PortAudio Library:

The Port Audio Library and its documentation has made this final project possible
and is very portable. There is a branch that I have created to support Mac OS Catalina
on my laptop and the library transfered over from Linux with ease.

You can find the PortAudio Library along with it's great docs here:
